# AI-Powered Data Enrichment with NVIDIA NIM

## Business Value

This project demonstrates a powerful integration between database systems and NVIDIA's NIM (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) for AI-driven data enrichment. By leveraging state-of-the-art language models, we can automatically generate high-quality, context-aware content to enhance existing data.

### Key Benefits:

1. **Automated Content Generation**: Reduce manual effort in creating product descriptions, summaries, or any text-based content.
2. **Scalability**: Process large volumes of data efficiently using NVIDIA's GPU-accelerated AI models.
3. **Improved Customer Experience**: Enhance product listings, search results, and user interfaces with AI-generated content.
4. **Data Enrichment**: Add value to existing data by augmenting it with AI-generated insights.
5. **Flexibility**: Easily adaptable to various industries and use cases, from e-commerce to content management systems.

## Technical Stack

### Current Implementation:

- **Database**: SQLite (for demonstration purposes)
- **AI Service**: NVIDIA NIM with Llama-3.1-8b-instruct model
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Key Libraries**: pandas, openai (for NIM API interaction)

### Strategic Partner Integration:

This solution is designed to be flexible and can easily integrate with various database systems and strategic partners. Here are some examples:

#### Teradata Integration:

To use Teradata instead of SQLite:

1. Install the Teradata Python package:
